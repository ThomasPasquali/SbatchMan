# variables.yaml
# Defines reusable variables for configurations and jobs.
# This is an example of strong scaling experiments.
# These include different datasets, modes (user defined semantic), implementations (and related args)

variables:
  # Directory, each file is a value.
  dataset: @dir datasets/

  # File, each line is a value.
  mode: @file modes.txt

  # Explicit values list. Same as ["impl1", "impl2", "impl3"].
  implementation:
    - "impl1"
    - "impl2"
    - "impl3"

  # This is basically a dictionary/map. The default value is optional.
  # If the default value is not set, accessing undefined keys will result in an error. 
  args:
    default: ""
    map:
      "impl1": "--arg-for-impl1 --another-for-impl1"
      "impl2": "--arg-for-impl2"

  # This is a map that uses as key the name of the cluster.
  nodes:
    default: [1, 2, 4, 8]
    per_cluster:
      clusterA: [1, 2, 4]
      clusterB: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]

  # This is a variable with a single value that will be later overwritten
  to_override: 'NOT OVERWRITTEN'
